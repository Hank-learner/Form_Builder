        <h3> Some facts on water</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Water has three different states, liquid, solid and gas.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The word water usually refers to water in its liquid state. The solid state of water is known
                as ice
                while the gas state of water is known as steam or water vapor.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Water covers around 70% of the Earth’s surface.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The three largest oceans on Earth are the Pacific Ocean (largest), the Atlantic Ocean (second
                largest) and the Indian Ocean (third largest). </li><br>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Found in the Pacific Ocean, the Mariana Trench is the deepest known point in the world’s
                oceans.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Ocean tides are caused by the rotation of the Earth and thegravitational
                pull of the Moon and Sun acting on ocean water.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Water from a sea or ocean is known as seawater. On average, every kilogram (2.2lb) of
                seawater
                contains around 35&nbsp;grams (1.2&nbsp;oz) of dissolved salt.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The freezing point of water lowers as the amount of salt dissolved in at increases. With
                average
                levels of salt, seawater freezes at -2&nbsp;°C (28.4&nbsp;°F).</li><br>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The longest river in the world is the Nile River, it reaches 6650
                    kilometers in
                    length (4132 miles).</p>
            </li><br>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>While most people know that water boils at 100&nbsp;°C (212&nbsp;°F), this is at the normal conditions of
                    sea
                    level. The boiling point of water actually changes relative to the barometric pressure. For example,
                    water boils
                    at just 68&nbsp;°C (154&nbsp;°F) on the top of Mount Everest while water deep in the ocean near
                    geothermal vents
                    can remain in liquid form at temperatures much higher than 100&nbsp;°C (212&nbsp;°F).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Water expands as it cools from 4 °C to 0 °C (above 4 °C it does the opposite). In freezing conditions,
                    water has
                    been known to burst water pipes as it freezes to ice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Water can move up narrow tubes against the force of gravity in what is known as capillary action.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Most people around the world have access to clean drinking water but it is a major problem in poorer areas
                    of the
                    world. Water pollution and low quality water can lead to dangerous bacteria, disease and viruses such as
                    E coli
                    and Cryptosporidium.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Drinking water is needed for humans to avoid dehydration, the amount you need
                    each
                    day depends on the temperature, how much activity you are involved in and other factors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>An important use for water is in agricultural irrigation, this is when water is artificially added to soil
                    in
                    order to assist the growth of crops.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Water is used frequently by firefighters to extinguish fires. Helicopters sometimes drop large amount of
                    water on
                    wildfires and bushfires to stop fires spreading and limit the damage they can cause.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The water industry helps deliver water to homes in various cities and countries around the world. This can
                    involve
                    services such as purification, sewage treatment, filtering, distillation and plumbing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Electricity can be created from hydropower, a process that uses water to
                    drive
                    water turbines connected to generators. There are many hydroelectric power stations around the world.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Water also plays a role in cooking. Steaming and boiling food are well known cooking methods. You may have
                    noticed
                    this last time you made pasta or noodles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Water is also used for fun. Water sports are a very popular recreational activity and include
                things
                like swimming, surfing and waterskiing. Ice and snow is also used in ice skating, ice hockey, skiing and
                snowboarding.</li>
